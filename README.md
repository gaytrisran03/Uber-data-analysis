 # Uber Data Analysis with R
 -------------------------

Welcome to the Uber Data Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Uber data using the R programming language. The goal of this analysis is to gain valuable insights into Uber's operations, trip patterns, demand distribution, and peak hours.

## Overview
 -------------------------

Uber has transformed the way people commute, and its massive volume of ride data offers a wealth of information waiting to be explored. In this project, we dive deep into this data to uncover meaningful patterns and trends, helping us understand how Uber operates and how it impacts transportation in various regions.

## Key Features
 -------------------------

- **R Notebook Implementation:** This analysis is presented as an R notebook, providing an interactive and easily reproducible environment. The R notebook format allows you to understand each step thoroughly and modify the code to suit your specific needs.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** We start by cleaning and preprocessing the raw Uber data to ensure it's in a usable format for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Through insightful visualizations and statistical summaries, we explore various aspects of Uber's operations, such as popular pickup and drop-off locations, travel distances, and temporal patterns.

- **Demand Distribution Analysis:** Uncover the geographical distribution of demand to identify areas with high demand and potential opportunities for drivers.

- **Peak Hour Identification:** Analyze peak hours and hotspots to optimize driving schedules and maximize earnings.

- **Insights for Business Owners:** For entrepreneurs and business analysts, this analysis offers valuable insights into potential markets and customer behavior.

## Replication Guide
 -------------------------

To replicate this analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have R and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary packages by running the following command in R:
   
```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "leaflet", "plotly", "ggmap"))
```

3. **Data Access:** Download the [Kaggle - Uber Data Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prakharrathi25/uber-data-analysis-in-r) and place it in the designated folder.

4. **Run the R Notebook:** Open the R notebook file and execute each cell to step through the analysis process.
